# Week1 Project: Horiseon site refactor

## Objective:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes made:
- Consolidated classes to use same style sheet entries
- Corrected link for Search Engine Optimization in topbar
- Corrected multiple "div" entries with more semantically correct "header," "aside," "footer," and "article."
- Made title more site specific.
- Added comments to CSS sheet
